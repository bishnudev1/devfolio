Currenly I'm pursing my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science & Engineering from CEM, Kolaghat. I got taste my first programming language in my 10th standard and it was Python. Since then I am trying to learn new technologies and building projects. Recently I have switched to Open Source Community to explore more variety of techs. I will be more happy if you call me a problem solver rather than just a developer :)</Text>
